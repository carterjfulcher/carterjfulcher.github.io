The way you disrupt a government is not with an army and soldiers.

I'll do it by beating the government 100x by every metric at it's own game. Who wants to move to my city state?

- 5 cent / kwh energy - this is theoretically possible. Nuclear would be the ideal, but solar is within a stones throw at scale. Idaho Power operates at 21% net margins.

- Affordable, luxury housing - You've been getting scammed on real estate purchases (I have). The cost to build a 3bed/2ba home at scale is around $165k in Idaho (I've verified this in a personal construction project)- but you've paid $400k! This is due to the land, utilities, and high developer margins. Lennar made $4.6 billion last year, over 20% gross margins. Mid scale developers make upwards of 40% margins (I partake in this, so I can't complain too much). Excluding the cost of land (which we'll acquire at scale anyways), I could build a luxury home around 1500sqft for near 120k. Seller financing available!

- 0% income tax, 0% corporate tax, 0% sales tax - We don't need your charity! We'll actually MAKE money on the services we provide. This is how a lot of governments in the tourist-era Middle East work. For sales tax, this is really to help the manufacturers in our city-state. Manufacturing a good to sell to our citizens should be cheaper than anywhere in the world.

- open source - Can you run a solar farm better? Can you build houses cheaper? You probably can. All documentation and design will be open source. Weekly, you can submit a bid and receive allocations as the city grows.

I was just in Washington, DC. There is billions of dollars of real estate, filled with tens of thousands of people, doing NOTHING! (I visited the "Government Accountability Building" on G Street NW while I was in DC)

They key with my city state, is that government services operate like a private equity company: with positive margins. This will allow us to offer services, without taking money from your pocket.

I like living in a nice area around wealthy people. This city state operates on the idea that wealth is a ratio, between expenses and income. Would you rather be able to get everything you could ever want for $1000/mo while making $10,000 a month, or make $1,000,000/mo but have expenses of $950,000/mo?

With cheap energy, luxury lifestyle, and business incentives, every large corporation and entrepreneur will have an interest in moving to my city state. We'll attract the best talent, the best jobs, the best industry, and be a center for global growth.

Are you moving?
