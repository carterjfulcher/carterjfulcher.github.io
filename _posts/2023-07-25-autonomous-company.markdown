How many jobs are pointless?

It is widely accepted that computers will be able to do
anything a human can do in 15 years. Perhaps recruiters, salesmen, marketers will be out of a job in the next few years. Although this sounds alarming, and may have immediate negative consequence, I believe it will be net positive in
the long term. Are you scared AI is going to sneak up on you and take your job? You have been warned for nearly 40 years: [Harvard Business Review from 1987](https://hbr.org/1987/07/thinking-about-artificial-intelligence).

I'm not saying being below the API line is bad, that's up for you to decide for yourself. Are you okay
with being told what to do by a robot?

Some people are panicking and [calling for AI research to be shut down](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oM9pEezyCb4dCsuKq/pausing-ai-developments-isn-t-enough-we-need-to-shut-it-all-1), while others think
that AI is going to [save the world](https://a16z.com/2023/06/06/ai-will-save-the-world/).

As for me? I don't really care.

# The Vision

I want to take this to the extreme, imagine a company void of any human input. A self contained system. Millions of transistors aligned towards a common goal. Can it be done?

# The Implementation

Starting a company is simple. Come up with an idea, validate it, and grow. Why can't a
machine be taught to do this? In a system that is largely stochastic, the best method seems
to be guess and check.

I'm working on building the following system:
