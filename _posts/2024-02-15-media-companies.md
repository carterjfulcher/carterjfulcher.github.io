On February 15th, 2024 OpenAI announced [Soma](https://openai.com/soma), a text to video diffusion model.

AI video generation has the possibility to be detrimental to media companies, particularly, movie studios, and other companies that profit of creating exclusive content.

The thesis is as follows.

> Investing in companies primarily monetizing proprietary content could pose a significant risk, as advancements in AI-generated video content lower barriers to entry, potentially causing revenue collapse and depreciation in company value.

Below is a list of companies engaged in the practice of monetizing proprietary content (called "Media Monetization Companies")
<br/>

| Ticker  | Name              | MC      |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| NFLX    | Netflix           | 256.83B |
| PARA    | Paramount         | 8.54B   |
| CMCSA   | Universal Studios | 166.02B |
| DIS     | Disney            | 206.27B |
| WBD     | Warner Brothers   | 24.73B  |
| LFG.A/B | Lionsgate Media   | 2.083B  |

## Content Assets

In the example of `NFLX`, the stock is trading at $593 on 2/15/24 with a market cap of $256.83 Billion, trading roughly at a 50x P/E valuation.

Per the latest [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/ixviewer/ix.html?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001065280/000106528023000273/nflx-20230930.htm), Netflix has 247,153 memberships at an average monthly revenue of $11.70 per membership. Netflx does _not_ have a significant moat when it comes to software (i.e., delivery). A talented engineer, or a small team could replicate the functionality of netflix.com in less than a week. In fact, there are almost a thousand clones of Netflix's software on [Github right now](https://github.com/topics/netflix-clone).

So what does Netflix have that Carter Fulcher Media LLC doesn't?

> "Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content. [...] Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content."

As a figure, Netflix spent $2.88 billion dollars in Q3 on content acquisitions, adding to their $31.74 billion dollar pool of content assets (64% of balance sheet). Here's a more in depth breakdown in thousands:<br/>

|                                   | 9/30/23    | 12/31/22   |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Licensed content, net             | 12,459,413 | 12,732,549 |
| Produced content, net             |            |            |
| Released, less amortization       | 9,433,878  | 9,110,518  |
| In Production                     | 9,052,140  | 10,225,940 |
| In development and pre-production | 804,430    | 637,706    |
| Content assets, net               | 31,749,861 | 32,736,713 |

Media Monetization Companies are only as good as their content assets. Without these assets, customers will not subscribe to their platform. Acquiring these assets is the primary barrier to entry.

As such, if AI generated content allows a vector to produce high quality, desirable content at a low cost, it's fair to say there will be significant disruption in these companies.

We do not yet have pricing regarding OpenAI's Soma, but I am guessing it will be several hundred dollars per hour of video produced. This is a steep discount off the several million dollars per hour of a modern day movie.

There are several weaknesses and limitations to the Soma model, such as inability to handle complex physics, restriction around violent content, and resolution constraints. However, I believe a combination of incremental improvements and the open source ML community will help minimize these issues.

I think the collapse of the moat around high quality cinematic content will be a "death by a thousand paper cuts" scenario for media companies. Hundreds, or thousands of smaller content creators will be able to produce and distribute (via platforms like YouTube, X, etc.) content cutting into the media companies' market share.
